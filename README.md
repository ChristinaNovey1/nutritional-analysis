# Nutritional Analysis

## Functionality

- Analyzes the nutritional values of hundreds of foods in a dataset and determines whether each food is healthy or unhealthy.
- Uses 3 different machine learning models to determine the healthiness of foods and compares the efficacy of each model.
- Includes Labeler class that manually determines the healthiness of foods using thresholds to calculate health scores, used to create "ground truth" values for machine learning models.

## Use

Allows users to learn which foods are healthy and should be added to their diet, and which foods are unhealthy and should be avoided or removed from their diet.

## Get Started

Run main.py to train and evaluate the machine learning models, and see the performance metrics for each model.
